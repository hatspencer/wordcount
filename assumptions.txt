Iteration 1:

- The input does not have linebreaks.
- Its assumed that words are separated by whitespace chars

Iteration 3:

- The application input file can consist of multiple lines

Iteration 4:

- Stretches of text which contain - are considered separate words
- Words which end with a . are accepted as words

Iteration 6:

- Average will be rounded HALF_UP and will be printed with two decimal places
- Hypens are part of the word length
- Stopwords are filtered also for statistics

Iteration 7:

- The index is sorted alphabetically, but not case sensitive
- Duplicate words are counted as one, and casing will stay untouched
- Two words which are the same but with different casing, will be listed as two separate words
- Stopwords are filtered also for the index
- From the supplied arguments only the first two valid ones will be taken, others will be ignored

Iteration 8:
- If the index argument is not passed, the dictionary argument does not have an effect
- The dictionary is case insensitive

Iteration 9:
- Repeated input only applies for user input and not file input
- The index and dictionary parameters can be specified only once (and they are applied for all the inputs)
- The processing is started right after submitting a user input
